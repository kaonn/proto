Generate the lex file (if you don't have mllex, just use the one already generated):
        mllex L1.lex (outputs L1.lex.sml)

For sml/nj:

start up sml:
- CM.make "sandbox.cm";
- open Sandbox;

For mlton (compiled, so not so useful when not printing):
Compile (slow since mlton does whole program analysis):
        mlton L1.mlb
